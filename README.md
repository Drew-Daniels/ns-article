#### TODO
1. Update Footer section so that  the gray background spans the entire bottom section of the document, not just what is in the container
2. Update the other article cards so that the image and text width are the same size (i.e., the text does not continue past the outer right edge of the picture like they do now)
3. Update the printer icon with an SVG that looks better and is not as pixelated.
4. Add a marker to show the currently selected reading category (in this case 'Space' would be selected and a dark blue bar would appear under the category in the main navbar)
